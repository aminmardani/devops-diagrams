The following diagram has the following steps:

- Slice the Generated manifests: you can use kubectl-slice to slice yaml files generated by Helm and then deploy them to kubernetes.Â 
- Waiting for Rollout: Ultimately you can wait for rolling out to detect which one deployed successfully or not.

you can follow these steps to deploy and wait for rollout of your workloads:

```bash
$ helm template --debug -n ${NAMESPACE} ${PROJECT_NAME} \
  ./helm-chart/ > all_manifests.yaml
$
$ kubectl-slice --input-file=all_manifests.yaml --output-dir=manifests
```
