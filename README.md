# DevOps open diagrams
In this repository I collected some useful devops related tools diagrams to be able to use them in my articles. 

I used `draw.io` website to creating diagram files and exported them in `.xml`. so if you want chnage them you first need to import them in `draw.io` website. 

for example one of the diagrams that is exist under `./devops-bigpicture/overall.xml` of this repository is like this:
<p align="center">
  <img src="devops-bigpicture/pictures/overall.png?raw=true" />
</p>
